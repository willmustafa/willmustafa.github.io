    description:
      "I am graduated in Civil Engineering and specialized in Software Engineering. During my time as a civil designer, I always looked for new technologies that would modernize the construction and automate my work, but I didn't find the necessary tools, so I decided to create them. I started in the programming world as a website developer still in high school, but it was as a Civil Engineer that I took a closer look at programming, starting with .NET and Javascript. Today I create solutions that help me on a daily basis, such as financial control and investments apps and also carry out research such as: What is the rate of book publications in Brazil for each ethnic group? Which politicians align with my principles?",
